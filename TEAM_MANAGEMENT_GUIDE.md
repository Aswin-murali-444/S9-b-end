# Team Management Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide explains how to implement team-based service providers for services like pesticide control, cleaning teams, maintenance crews, etc. The solution extends the existing individual service provider system to support group-based service delivery.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Database Schema

The team management system uses three main tables:

1. **`teams`** - Stores team information
2. **`team_members`** - Many-to-many relationship between teams and users
3. **`team_assignments`** - Tracks team assignments to specific bookings

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Team Creation**: Create teams with a designated team leader
- ‚úÖ **Member Management**: Add/remove team members with different roles
- ‚úÖ **Service Assignment**: Assign teams to specific services or categories
- ‚úÖ **Booking Coordination**: Handle team-based bookings and assignments
- ‚úÖ **Role Management**: Support for leader, supervisor, member, and trainee roles
- ‚úÖ **Capacity Management**: Set maximum team size limits

## üìã Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Run the team management schema:

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd S9-b-end

# Run the team management schema in your Supabase SQL editor
# Copy and paste the contents of team-management-schema.sql
```

### 2. Backend Setup

The team management APIs are already integrated into the backend:

- **Routes**: `/teams` endpoints for all team operations
- **Middleware**: Team creation, member management, and assignment handling
- **Database**: Automatic triggers for data integrity

### 3. Frontend Setup

The frontend has been updated with:

- **Enhanced AddServiceProviderPage**: Supports both individual and team creation
- **Team Management UI**: Visual interface for team member selection
- **API Integration**: Complete team management API integration

## üöÄ Usage Guide

### Creating a Team

1. **Navigate to Admin Dashboard**
   - Go to "Add Service Provider"
   - Select "Team Provider" option

2. **Team Information**
   - Enter team name (e.g., "Pest Control Team Alpha")
   - Set maximum team members (2-20)
   - Add team description (optional)

3. **Team Leader Setup**
   - Fill in team leader's personal information
   - Select service category and specific service
   - Set account status (active/pending verification)

4. **Add Team Members**
   - Browse available service providers
   - Select team members from the list
   - Remove members if needed (up to capacity limit)

5. **Submit Team Creation**
   - System creates team leader account first
   - Then creates team with assigned members
   - Sends credentials to team leader via email

### Managing Teams

#### View All Teams
```javascript
// Get all teams
const teams = await apiService.getTeams();

// Filter by category
const pestControlTeams = await apiService.getTeams({
  category_id: 'pest-control-category-id'
});

// Include inactive teams
const allTeams = await apiService.getTeams({
  include_inactive: true
});
```

#### Update Team Details
```javascript
// Update team information
await apiService.updateTeam(teamId, {
  name: 'Updated Team Name',
  description: 'New description',
  max_members: 8
});
```

#### Add Team Members
```javascript
// Add a new member to team
await apiService.addTeamMember(teamId, {
  user_id: 'user-uuid',
  role: 'member' // or 'supervisor', 'trainee'
});
```

#### Remove Team Members
```javascript
// Remove member from team
await apiService.removeTeamMember(teamId, memberId);
```

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. Pest Control Services

**Scenario**: A pest control service requires a team of 3-4 people for large commercial properties.

**Implementation**:
- Create "Pest Control Team Alpha" with max 5 members
- Assign team leader (senior technician)
- Add team members (technicians, assistants)
- Assign to "Pest Control" service category

**Booking Flow**:
- Customer books pest control service
- System assigns entire team to booking
- Team leader coordinates with members
- All members work together on the job

### 2. Cleaning Services

**Scenario**: Office cleaning requires different specialists (floor cleaning, window cleaning, sanitization).

**Implementation**:
- Create "Office Cleaning Crew" with max 6 members
- Assign specialists for different cleaning areas
- Team leader coordinates daily schedules
- Assign to "Commercial Cleaning" service

### 3. Maintenance Teams

**Scenario**: Building maintenance requires electricians, plumbers, and general maintenance workers.

**Implementation**:
- Create "Building Maintenance Team" with max 8 members
- Include specialists for different trades
- Team leader handles work coordination
- Assign to "Building Maintenance" service category
